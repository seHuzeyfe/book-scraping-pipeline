# Book Scraping and Analysis System

A web scraping solution for books.toscrape.com with data analysis capabilities to group similar books based on descriptions.

## Features
- ðŸ“š Scrapes book metadata (title, rating, price, stock, description)
- ðŸ’¾ Saves data in JSON format with batch processing
- ðŸ§® Displays total book count
- ðŸ¤– Groups books by description similarity using NLP techniques
- âš¡ Multi-threaded scraping with retry mechanism

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- Web Scraping: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`
- NLP Processing: `scikit-learn`
- Data Handling: `dataclasses`, `json`

## Installation
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seHuzeyfe/book-scraping-pipeline.git
   cd book-scraping-pipeline
   ```

2. Create virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv book_scraping_pipeline_venv
   source book_scraping_pipeline_venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   book_scraping_pipeline_venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the complete pipeline:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Process Flow:
#### Scraping Phase:
- Multi-threaded scraping of book data
- Automatic pagination handling
- Saves batches to `data/books_batch_*.json`
- Final output: `data/books_final.json`

#### Analysis Phase:
- Loads scraped data
- Calculates TF-IDF vectors
- Groups books by cosine similarity
- Saves groups to `data/book_groups.json`
- Prints summary to console

## Design Notes
### SOLID Principles:
- **Single Responsibility** (separate scraper/analyzer)
- **Open/Closed** (extendable scraping logic)
- **Dependency Inversion** (abstracted HTTP client)

### Patterns:
- **Factory Method** (Book dataclass)
- **Strategy** (similarity calculation)
- **Observer** (progress tracking)
