### Process Flow:
#### Scraping Phase:
- Multi-threaded scraping of book data
- Automatic pagination handling
- Saves batches to `data/books_batch_*.json`
- Final output: `data/books_final.json`

#### Analysis Phase:
- Both method Loads scraped data from `data/books_final.json`

- Calculates TF-IDF vectors
- Groups books by cosine similarity (default: 0.6)
- Saves groups to `tfidf_book_groups.json`
- Prints summary to console

- Generates SBERT embeddings for book descriptions using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- Calculates a cosine similarity matrix between book embeddings
- Groups similar books based on a similarity threshold (default: 0.6)
- Extracts key themes from descriptions using TextBlob
- Saves similarity groups to `sbert_book_groups.json`
- Prints an analysis summary to the console

## Comparison of TF-IDF and SBERT Methods

Both models group books based on description similarity but behave differently:

### **TF-IDF**
- Forms fewer groups (8 total), indicating broader categorization based on word overlap.  
- Higher similarity scores (e.g., 0.85) suggest strong lexical matches.  
- Captures surface-level similarities but may miss deeper semantic connections.  

### **SBERT**
- Produces more groups (59 total), detecting finer semantic differences.  
- Lower similarity scores (e.g., 0.60‚Äì0.73) but better at understanding meaning beyond exact words.  
- Extracts themes from descriptions, offering richer insights.  

### **Summary**
TF-IDF is simpler and groups books broadly, while SBERT provides more detailed, context-aware clustering.

## Design Notes
### SOLID Principles:
- **Single Responsibility** (separate scraper/analyzer)
- **Open/Closed** (extendable scraping logic)
- **Dependency Inversion** (abstracted HTTP client)

### Patterns:
- **Factory Method** (Book dataclass)
- **Strategy** (similarity calculation using TF-IDF and SBERT embeddings)
- **Observer** (progress tracking)
